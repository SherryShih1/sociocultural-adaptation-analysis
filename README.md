# Sociocultural Adaptation Analysis for ESL Peer Mentorship Program

## Research Overview
This research analyzes the effectiveness of an ESL Peer Mentorship Program on international students' sociocultural adaptation at Northeastern University. The study examines how peer support influences adaptation across five key domains.

## Research Team
- Student Researchers: Yvonne Leung, Hsiu-Yu (Sherry) Shih
- Institution: Northeastern University
- Date: April 23, 2025

## Research Objectives
- Evaluate the impact of peer mentorship on ESL students' sociocultural adaptation
- Analyze adaptation patterns across five domains: Interpersonal, Academic, Interest, Ecological, and Language
- Identify which student populations benefit most from peer support
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for program enhancement

## Methodology

**Study Design**
- Participants: 60 ESL students in peer mentorship program
- Design: Pre-post assessment measuring adaptation across 21 items
- Analysis: 5 statistical models including linear regression, mixed-effects, and MANOVA

**Five Adaptation Domains**
1. Interpersonal (7 items): Social relationships and interactions
2. Academic (4 items): Educational adjustment and performance
3. Interest (4 items): Engagement with activities and hobbies
4. Ecological (4 items): Environmental and living adaptation
5. Language (2 items): Communication confidence and skills

## Key Findings

**Overall Program Impact**
- Significant improvement in overall adaptation scores (p < 0.01)
- All five domains showed positive gains over time
- Program particularly effective for students with lower initial adaptation

**Language Background Insights**
- Chinese-speaking students started with lower baseline scores
- However, they showed comparable or greater improvement rates
- Largest gains in Language and Interpersonal domains

**Predictors of Success**
- Initial adaptation level was the strongest predictor (RÂ² = 0.138)
- Students with lower starting scores showed the most improvement
- Time in the U.S. showed trending but not significant effects

## Program Recommendations

1. Early Identification: Screen incoming students for low adaptation scores
2. Targeted Support: Provide intensive mentorship for at-risk students
3. Cultural Matching: Consider L1 background when pairing mentors
4. Domain Focus: Emphasize interpersonal and language support for Chinese speakers
5. Continuous Assessment: Track progress across all five domains

## Technical Details
- Software: R (version 4.0+)
- Packages: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, lme4, e1071
- Statistical Approaches:
  - Change score analysis
  - Mixed-effects modeling for repeated measures
  - MANOVA for multi-domain analysis
  - Data imputation for missing values

## Program Impact
This research demonstrates that peer mentorship:
- Effectively improves ESL student adaptation
- Benefits all students regardless of background
- Is especially valuable for struggling students
- Creates measurable improvements across multiple life domains

## Ethical Considerations
- IRB approved research
- All participant data anonymized
- Aggregate reporting only
